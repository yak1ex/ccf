C++ Compiler Firm
=================

C++ Compiler Firm (ccf) is just my personal ongoing project. The goal of this project is to make proof-of-concept prototype of online compiler site, like codepad or ideone, to compare results by several C++ compilers. This project maybe consists of the following 3 parts.

* Frontend (web interface)
* Backend (compiler/resultant executable invocation server)
* Sandbox environment

Currently, sandbox environment is being investigated.
