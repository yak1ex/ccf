C++ Compiler Farm
=================

C++ Compiler Farm (ccf) is just my personal ongoing project. The goal of this project is to make proof-of-concept prototype of online compiler site, like codepad or ideone, to compare results by several C++ compilers. This project maybe consists of the following 3 parts:

* Frontend (web interface)
* Backend (compiler/resultant executable invocation server)
* Sandbox environment

Currently, prototype system w/o sandbox starts to work. A trial site will be public, soon.
