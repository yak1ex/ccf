C++ Compiler Farm
=================

C++ Compiler Farm (ccf) is just my personal ongoing project. The goal of this project is to make proof-of-concept prototype of online compiler site, like codepad or ideone, to compare results by several C++ compilers. This project consists of the following 3 parts:

* Frontend (web interface)
* Backend (compiler/resultant executable invocation server)
* Sandbox environment (from [The Chromium Projects](http://www.chromium.org/))

You can try it on http://ccf.myhome.cx:5000/ccf.html
